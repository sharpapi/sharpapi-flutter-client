## Installation

1. Add sharpapi_flutter_client to your `pubspec.yaml` file
    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      sharpapi_flutter_client: ^latest_version
    ```
   
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

3. Register at [SharpApi.com](https://sharpapi.com/) and get the API key.
   **That's it!**

## Usage

1. Import the package in your dart file
    ```dart
    import 'package:sharpapi_flutter_client/sharpapi_flutter_client.dart';
    ```
   
2. Initialize the `SharpApiConfigs` with your API key in the `main` method
    ```dart
   void main() {
      SharpApiConfigs.init(
        apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
      );

      runApp(const MyApp());
    }
    ```

**Each call usually takes somewhere between a couple of seconds to a minute.**

After that period a returned response will usually have `success` status and it's results will
be available for further processing.
Each API method returns different return format.
[Go to List of API methods/endpoints below for details&raquo;](#list-of-api-methodsendpoints)

**Our API guarantees to return correct format every time.** AI engines that SharpAPI
use in rare cases have a tendency to misbehave and timeout
or return incorrect data.
In those cases the returned `status` for the job will be `failed`.
You can rerun the exact same job request in that case.

As long as the job is still being processed by our engine it will keep
returning `pending` status.

## List of API methods/endpoints

For methods that have language parameter you can also
use `SharpApiLanguages` Enum values to make your code more readable.
